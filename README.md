# Example Portfolio

This is an example portfolio design I have made to showcase the projects and tasks I built during my bootcamp course.

## Process

First I made a couple of wireframes based on things I liked in other portfolio designs, I picked one, and I adapted it to include colours and a bit of extra styling. This may not match the final design, but serves as a jumping off point. Note: the design includes the clicked and unclicked state of my boxes. If I were doing it again, I would label that, and add an indication of what should happen on a hover state.

Next I made a copy without colours and added the structural elements required and some notes on how I would achieve layout. This allowed me to improve my code before I began; e.g. I realised that flex or grid would be a better choice for one section than an automatic margin, which had been my first thought. I also wireframed some mobile components to make sure my structure would be responsive. 

## About the tech

I decided to use Tailwind, which we had used the previous week on the course, as I found it make the process of building my website faster.

I started by building the structure of the HTML - general layout, etc - for desktop.
